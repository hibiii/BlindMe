A client-sided mod that gives you the Blindness (or Darkness) effect all the time.
Configurable per world and server.

Additionally, BlindMe can be used as a server mod affecting all players.

## Using

By default, new worlds and servers don't have any effects turned on.
To change this, use the `/blindme` command, or use the settings screen accessible through Mod Menu.

## Using on the server

By default, the server drops a default configuration file in `./config/blindme.server.props`, and runs using it.
To change this, open the file in a text editor, it contains usage information.

## Requirements

- Quilt Loader / Fabric Loader
- Quilt Standard Libraries / Fabric API
- Mod Menu (optionally)
