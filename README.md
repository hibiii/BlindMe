# BlindMe

A client-sided mod that gives you the Blindness (or Darkness) effect all the time.
Configurable per world and server.

This is where a screenshot would go, but it would be mostly dark except for the HUD and very few blocks!

Currently a beta version, there might be some bugs.
Licensed under MIT, made by hibi.

## Using

By default, new worlds and servers have the Blindness effect applied by default.
To change this, use the settings screen (accessible through Mod Menu), or use the `/blindme` command.
A world can have the blindness effect disabled, too.

## Requirements

- Quilt Loader
- Quilt Standard Libraries
- Mod Menu (optionally)
